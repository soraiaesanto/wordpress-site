I\u2019m not sure if it was the sheer size of the place, or whether the masses congregated in one area and didn\u2019t venture far from the main church, but I didn\u2019t feel overwhelmed by tourists in the monastery.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/sessao10\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/boy1.jpg\" class=\"td-modal-image\"><div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/sessao10\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/boy1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-126\" width=\"307\" height=\"443\"\/><figcaption>City Guide for Vienna<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div><\/a><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"max-width:600px\">Headed over Lions Bridge and made our way to the Sofia Synagogue, then sheltered in the Central Market Hall until the recurrent (but short-lived) mid-afternoon rain passed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"max-width:600px\">Feeling refreshed after an espresso, we walked a short distance to the small but welcoming Banya Bashi Mosque, then descended into the ancient Serdica complex.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"max-width:600px\">We were exhausted after a long day of travel, so we headed back to the hotel and crashed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"max-width:600px\"> I had low expectations about Sofia as a city, but after the walking tour I absolutely loved the place. This was an easy city to navigate, and it was a beautiful city \u2013 despite its ugly, staunch and stolid communist-built surrounds. Sofia has a very average facade as you enter the city, but once you lose yourself in the old town area, everything changes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"max-width:600px\">Clothes can transform your mood and confidence. Fashion moves so quickly that, unless you have a strong point of view, you can lose integrity. I like to be real. I don\u2019t like things to be staged or fussy. I think I\u2019d go mad if I didn\u2019t have a place to escape to.
